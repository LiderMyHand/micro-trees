# A Minimalistic Behavior Tree Implementation for MicroPython

This library provides a minimalistic yet powerful implementation of a behavior tree designed specifically for use with MicroPython on microcontrollers. It is aimed at developers looking to incorporate sophisticated control structures into their robotics, automation, or IoT projects without the overhead of more complex frameworks.

## Features

- **Lightweight Design**: Optimized for the constrained environments of microcontrollers.
- **Easy to Extend**: Designed with extendability in mind, allowing for easy addition of custom nodes and behaviors.
- **Safety and Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms for managing errors and ensuring the safety of operations.
- **User-defined Tasks**: Supports the creation of tasks according to user-defined criteria and conditions.
